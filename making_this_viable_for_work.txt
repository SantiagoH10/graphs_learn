How to make this stuff actually possible to insert into a damn report?

First of all, get vol_contrib_data in csv UTF-8 and not only csv (encoding problems)

Create a separate file for variables that auto update (current_year and current_week and not hard coded)

My idea for now is to get to know the libraries and options they offer and just try to make the most of it
without thinking on how I'm going to present all that (maybe an online code editor or even Python in Excel supports it)
